This STUN extension defines the following new attributes:

0x000C: CHANNEL-NUMBER
0x000D: LIFETIME
0x0010: Reserved (was BANDWIDTH)

0x0022: RESERVATION-TOKEN


This document defines the following new error response codes:

403  (Forbidden): The request was valid but cannot be performed due
	to administrative or similar restrictions.

437  (Allocation Mismatch): A request was received by the server that
	requires an allocation to be in place, but no allocation exists,
	or a request was received that requires no allocation, but an
	allocation exists.

441  (Wrong Credentials): The credentials in the (non-Allocate)
	request do not match those used to create the allocation.

442  (Unsupported Transport Protocol): The Allocate request asked the
	server to use a transport protocol between the server and the peer
	that the server does not support.  NOTE: This does NOT refer to
	the transport protocol used in the 5-tuple.

486  (Allocation Quota Reached): No more allocations using this
	username can be created at the present time.

508  (Insufficient Capacity): The server is unable to carry out the
	request due to some capacity limit being reached.  In an Allocate
	response, this could be due to the server having no more relayed
	transport addresses available at that time, having none with the
	requested properties, or the one that corresponds to the specified
	reservation token is not available.
